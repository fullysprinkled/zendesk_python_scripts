description: This script creates followup tickets for all tickets linked to a jira issue key via Zendesk's Jira app integration (https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/jira/)
Every ticket linked to a given jira issue key receives a followup ticket.
to do: 
1) add proper rate limiting flow
2) additional_tags can't be added in same endpoint so we'll need to chunk ticket IDs through update_many API as an afterstep if we need to add tags to the followup ticket
